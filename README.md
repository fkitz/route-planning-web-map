# Web Map: Route Planning Application
As part of my [GIS Certificate](https://continuing.torontomu.ca/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=170501), I completed a course in [web mapping](https://continuing.torontomu.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do;jsessionid=67F1512ED5C4DF4997AC34DDA0DB2000?method=load&courseId=25659). The aim of this assignment was to create a simple web map for a specific purpose and audience.

**Pathfinder** is a route planning application aimed at pedestrians and runners. It utilizes the ArcGIS JavaScript API, and includes several features:
* Fullscreen toggle
* Zoom buttons
* Address search bar
* Export route option (.pdf or .jpg)
* New measurement/route (reset button)

* **Languages**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
